# PingPong

I made my first game and it is still in development state.
I am going to work on the following thing:

  - power ups that appear rondom
    - check if space around appearing is free
    - create power up on the screen
    - detect collision with the ball
    - detect from which player the ball came from
    - set a timer for how long the power up last
    
  - different types of powerup
    - a power up for paddle extension
    - a power up for random speed (only for player with power up)
    - a power up for invisable ball (pc doesnt move or gets back to the center of the canvas)
    - slows down the other player
    
  - different lever of computer
    - noob
    - easy
    - medium
    - hard
    - extreem
